# This is an example config file for OS-Installer.
# To use it either pass it as the commandline config parameter or place it at
# /etc/os-installer/config.yaml
# If a value is not defined, its default will be used.

# Some strings can be translated. Translations need to be available under
# /etc/os-installer/po/ and can be generated by running the script
# po/update_translations.sh in the folder in which this file is located.
# To generate new translation files for e.g. language 'te_ST' run:
# msginit --no-translator -i po/config.pot -o po/[te_ST].po 

# Name of the distribution.
# Default: 'Untitled'
distribution_name: 'Horizon'

# After gathering all configured information, os-installer runs the scripts
# configured here. The installation can happen in up to three phases. A phase
# will be skipped if no script is configured for it.
#
# To see what is available per phase, see the examples scripts. If an "install"
# phase is configured, the installer behaves slightly different:
# * A separate confirmation page is shown before user configuration happens
# * Navigating to pre-confirmation pages is not possible after confirmation
# * Language, desktop and disk choices can not be changed from the summary page
#
# If an internet connection is required, it will be available for all phases.
#
# prepare   - Run directly or when an internet connection is available.
# install   - Run with locale, disk and optional desktop configured.
# configure - Run with everything configured.
